### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mohamed Abouzid, and I'm currently located in [Hamburg, Germany](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PKU9iqXVBTLBE3Yd9). I am a machine learning enthusiast with a focus on bioinformatics and biological networks. Currently, I am working on my Masterâ€™s thesis at the University of Hamburg in the [CosyBio](https://www.cosy.bio/) lab, where we're expanding the development of [StrucTFactor](https://apps.cosy.bio/StrucTFactor/), a software that leverages neural networks for biological network analysis and transcription factor prediction. My research explores how deep learning can be applied to understand gene regulation and transcriptional control.

Previously, I worked on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. During this time, I studied immune and fat cells to investigate their relationship with metabolic factors and disease development. My work combined computational biology with data science to extract meaningful insights from large-scale sequencing data.

My interests lie at the intersection of data science, biological networks, and systems biology, and I am passionate about leveraging computational tools to drive discoveries in life sciences.

Originally from Egypt, I moved to Germany to start my career as a pharmacist before following my passion for bioinformatics. This led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Bioinformatics at [Justus-Liebig University](https://www.uni-giessen.de/en/index) in GieÃŸen. Beyond research, I create content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MohamedAbouzidBio), sharing insights on studying in Germany and bioinformatics, along with practical advice for international students and expats navigating life in Germany. You can find more about my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/MohamedAbouzid1) and read about my experiences on my [blog]().
