## Introduction  

Welcome to my blog! In this first post, I want to share a bit about my journeyâ€”how I transitioned from pharmacy to bioinformatics and machine learning, and what excites me about this field.  

## From Pharmacy to Bioinformatics  

I started my career as a pharmacist, but I was always fascinated by data, computational tools, and how they can be used to solve complex biological problems. This curiosity led me to pursue a Master's degree in Bioinformatics, where I delved into data analysis, biological networks, and AI-driven research.  

## My Current Work  

Right now, Iâ€™m working on my Masterâ€™s thesis at the University of Hamburg in the [CosyBio](https://www.cosy.bio/) lab. My research focuses on expanding the capabilities of [StrucTFactor](https://apps.cosy.bio/StrucTFactor/), a software that applies neural networks to predict transcription factors and analyze biological networks.  

## Why This Blog?  

Through this blog, I want to document my experiences, share insights on bioinformatics and machine learning, and provide useful resources for others interested in the field. Iâ€™ll be posting about:  

- Research updates and interesting findings  
- Tutorials on tools like Scanpy, StrucTFactor, and deep learning frameworks  
- Tips for students and researchers in bioinformatics  
- My personal experiences as an international student in Germany
