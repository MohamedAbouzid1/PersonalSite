## Wrapping Up My Internship

The past few months have been a whirlwind! I recently finished my internship, where I worked on single-cell RNA
sequencing analysis, focusing on macrophages, adipocytes, and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM cells). It was an
exciting experience that gave me hands-on exposure to large-scale biological data and reinforced my interest in
bioinformatics.

## Moving On to My Master's Thesis

Now, I’m fully focused on my Master’s thesis at the [CosyBio](https://www.cosy.bio/) lab at the University of Hamburg.
My work involves expanding [StrucTFactor](https://apps.cosy.bio/StrucTFactor/), a tool that applies neural networks for
transcription factor prediction and biological network analysis. This project combines machine learning, bioinformatics,
and software development—exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy.

## Balancing Research and Content Creation

Aside from research, I’ve been trying to stay consistent with my YouTube channel. I’ve been creating content on studying
in Germany, bioinformatics, and machine learning. It’s been great connecting with so many people who are on similar
journeys!

## What’s Next?

In the coming months, I plan to:

- Dive deeper into developing **StrucTFactor** and exploring its applications.
- Share more tutorials and insights from my research.
- Keep creating helpful content for students and expats in Germany.

That’s all for now! If you’re interested in bioinformatics, AI, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out

Until next time! ✌️
