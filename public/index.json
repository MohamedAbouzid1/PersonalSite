I am a machine learning enthusiast with a focus on bioinformatics and biological networks. Currently, I am working on my Masterâ€™s thesis at the University of Hamburg in the CosyBio lab, where we\u0026rsquo;re expanding the development of StrucTFactor, a software that leverages neural networks for biological network analysis and transcription factor prediction. My research explores how deep learning can be applied to understand gene regulation and transcriptional control.\nPreviously, I worked on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. During this time, I studied immune and fat cells to investigate their relationship with metabolic factors and disease development. My work combined computational biology with data science to extract meaningful insights from large-scale sequencing data.\nMy interests lie at the intersection of data science, biological networks, and systems biology, and I am passionate about leveraging computational tools to drive discoveries in life sciences.\nOriginally from Egypt, I moved to Germany to start my career as a pharmacist before following my passion for bioinformatics. This led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Bioinformatics at Justus-Liebig University in GieÃŸen. Beyond research, I create content on YouTube, sharing insights on studying in Germany and bioinformatics, along with practical advice for international students and expats navigating life in Germany. You can find more about my projects on my GitHub and read about my experiences on my blog.\nContact GitHub LinkedIn Email Resume (PDF) ","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"About","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
