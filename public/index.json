I recently finished my internship, where I worked on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, focusing on macrophages, adipocytes, and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM cells). It was an exciting experience that gave me hands-on exposure to large-scale biological data and reinforced my interest in bioinformatics.\nMoving On to My Master\u0026rsquo;s Thesis Now, I‚Äôm fully focused on my Master‚Äôs thesis at the CosyBio lab at the University of Hamburg. My work involves expanding StrucTFactor, a tool that applies neural networks for transcription factor prediction and biological network analysis. This project combines machine learning, bioinformatics, and software development‚Äîexactly the kind of challenge I enjoy.\nBalancing Research and Content Creation Aside from research, I‚Äôve been trying to stay consistent with my YouTube channel. I‚Äôve been creating content on studying in Germany, bioinformatics, and machine learning. It‚Äôs been great connecting with so many people who are on similar journeys!\nWhat‚Äôs Next? In the coming months, I plan to:\nDive deeper into developing StrucTFactor and exploring its applications. Share more tutorials and insights from my research. Keep creating helpful content for students and expats in Germany. That‚Äôs all for now!

In this first post, I want to share a bit about my journey‚Äîhow I transitioned from pharmacy to bioinformatics and machine learning, and what excites me about this field.\nFrom Pharmacy to Bioinformatics I started my career as a pharmacist, but I was always fascinated by data, computational tools, and how they can be used to solve complex biological problems. This curiosity led me to pursue a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Bioinformatics, where I delved into data analysis, biological networks, and AI-driven research.\nMy Current Work Right now, I‚Äôm working on my Master‚Äôs thesis at the University of Hamburg in the CosyBio lab. My research focuses on expanding the capabilities of StrucTFactor, a software that applies neural networks to predict transcription factors and analyze biological networks.\nWhy This Blog? Through this blog, I want to document my experiences, share insights on bioinformatics and machine learning, and provide useful resources for others interested in the field. I‚Äôll be posting about:\nResearch updates and interesting findings Tutorials on tools like Scanpy, StrucTFactor, and deep learning frameworks Tips for students and researchers in bioinformatics My personal experiences as an international student in Germany Stay Connected If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in bioinformatics, AI, or just want to follow my journey, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my GitHub.\nStay tuned for more posts soon! üöÄ\n","date":"28 February 2025","permalink":"/posts/1-hello/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My Journey into Bioinformatics and Machine Learning"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/research/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Research"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/updates/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Updates"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/youtube/","section":"","summary":"","title":""},{"content":"Hey üëã My name is Mohamed Abouzid, and I\u0026rsquo;m currently located in Hamburg, Germany. I am a machine learning enthusiast with a focus on bioinformatics and biological networks. Currently, I am working on my Master‚Äôs thesis at the University of Hamburg in the CosyBio lab, where we\u0026rsquo;re expanding the development of StrucTFactor, a software that leverages neural networks for biological network analysis and transcription factor prediction. My research explores how deep learning can be applied to understand gene regulation and transcriptional control.\nPreviously, I worked on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. During this time, I studied immune and fat cells to investigate their relationship with metabolic factors and disease development. My work combined computational biology with data science to extract meaningful insights from large-scale sequencing data.\nMy interests lie at the intersection of data science, biological networks, and systems biology, and I am passionate about leveraging computational tools to drive discoveries in life sciences.\nOriginally from Egypt, I moved to Germany to start my career as a pharmacist before following my passion for bioinformatics. This led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree in Bioinformatics at Justus-Liebig University in Gie√üen. Beyond research, I create content on YouTube, sharing insights on studying in Germany and bioinformatics, along with practical advice for international students and expats navigating life in Germany.
